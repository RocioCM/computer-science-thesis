\chapter{Showcasing the First Annex}
\guideinfo{Annexes are supplementary sections in a dissertation that provide additional information or external documents not essential to the main arguments but that support or complement the research. Unlike appendices, \textbf{annexes generally contain material that was not developed by the author}, such as reports, legal documents, or published datasets from external sources. This information is placed separately to keep the main content concise, allowing readers access to relevant external references without disrupting the dissertation's flow.}
