\chapter{Showcasing the First Appendix}
\guideinfo{Appendices contain supplementary material \textbf{created by the author} that enhances the readerâ€™s understanding of the dissertation while not being essential for following the primary narrative. These sections often include detailed tables, figures, complex calculations, or materials like survey questions and interview transcripts produced in the course of the research. The appendices allow readers to explore the research in greater detail, offering a deeper insight into methods and findings without interrupting the main body of work.}
